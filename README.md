## Assignment
Design and implement an extensible Board Game Server

## Requirements

- The Board Game Server should accommodate any board game that involves a grid layout and game elements on this layout, including games such as Chess, Checkers, Tic-Tac-Toe, Gomoku, **Connect Four**, Nine Men's Morris, **Chutes and Ladders**, Stratego, Shogi, Pente, **Battleship**â€¦
- The Board Game Server should make it as easy as possible to create implementations of new games.
- The Board Game Server should provide a defined interface that all game plug-ins must follow.
- The Board Game Server should be a client-server Java application, not Web-based. However, the server can be a local server and have the different players all on one machine.
- The Board Game Server should provide one or more ways for people to find other players.
- The Board Game Server should support personal player profiles (the specifics of which are up to you). Login can be very simple, and does not have to be secure.
- The Board Game Server need only support 2-player games (but you can support more players if you want to).
- The Board Game Server should work by providing a player with a list of games they can play and allow them to choose which one to start.
- The Board Game Server games should be GUI-based.
- ~~The Board Game Server should be written in Java~~


## Grading Criteria

- **Stakeholder:** the player (how is the experience of playing a game?)
- **Stakeholder:** future developers of the Board Game Server (how is the understandability and quality of the code and design?)
- **Stakeholder:** game developers (how is the extensibility of the Board Game Server in supporting new board games? how is the experience of plugging in a new game?)
- **Stakeholder:** you (what are your contributions to the project?)
